Tools for plotting in hopes of encouraging reproducible research.

# Installation

One can clone the repository and install using
```
git clone -b master https://github.com/jordan-melendez/rrplot.git
cd rrplot
pip install .
```
<!-- Change `-b {branch}` to `-b master` etc. if desired. -->
This will install the package as is, but if you are contributing then exchange the last line with `pip install -e .`, which allows edits made to the repository to take effect in real time.
